# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m creator of 365Layouts ðŸŒ±

## 365Layouts - web2print/Desktop Publishing 
365Layouts is an open source desktop publishing system (DTP) . 365Layouts is building an online drag and drop design platform to help small business owners create advertising materials with our free design templates. 

Out of scope (at least for near future) are Office documents (ODT, DOCX....), text files (notes) which usually are editable. In future 365Layouts might support Office documents (ODT etc), but that feature will be provided as plugins. ðŸ¤”

### Review https://www.ilovefreesoftware.com/14/featured/free-online-adobe-indesign-alternatives.html: 
"... You can fully edit the templates according to your needs and then export them as PDF. It allows you to create designs like posters, business cards .... You can easily create a high-resolution publication (up to 1200 DPI) and chose the format and orientation of your design as well. It supports a lot of formats like A4, A2 a lot others. You can easily create your design from scratch or from the template and then export it ... Desygner, Lucidpress, and 365Layouts are the best alternatives to Adobe InDesign ...."
